                <h3>Energy mechanics</h3>
                <p>Energy is the core upgrading mechanic of the game. Each player can individually collect energy by different means, and can become more powerful with them. Each blue energy gives 1% jump height and 1% speed to the player, and each green energy gives a fair boost to the player's damage against the Gods.</p>
                <p>Energy collection methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>jumping on <a href="platforms.html#energy-platform">Energy platform</a>s or <a href="platforms.html#trick-or-treat-platform">Trick or Treat platform</a>s</li>
                    <li>executing other players in <a href="gamemodes.html#comp-gamemode">Competitive Multiplayer</a></li>
                    <li>leveling up in <a href="gamemodes.html#comp-gamemode">Competitive Multiplayer</a></li>
                    <li>getting shared energy through Brothers-in-Arms connection in <a href="gamemodes.html#coop-gamemode">Cooperative Multiplayer</a></li>

                <h3>Brothers-in-Arms system</h3>
                <p>Brothers-in-Arms system is only available in <a href="gamemodes.html#coop-gamemode">Cooperative Multiplayer</a> game mode. Each player has a Brothers connection with each other, which they can strengthen through the following methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>assisting each other (pressing both movement keys at the same time to toss a player above they are touching)</li>
                    <li>resurrecting each other via the <a href="platforms.html#resurrection-platform">Resurrection</a> platform</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When a Brothers connection reaches its maximum, the two players become Brothers-in-Arms, which appear in the middle of the screen. Being Brothers-in-Arms means lots of opportinuties for both players:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>shared <a href="#energy-mechanics">energy</a> collection</li>
                    <li>temporary energy boost in a medium range</li>
                    <li>negative effect immunity in a close range</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="duel-system">
                <h3>Duel system</h3>
                <p>The Duel system is only available in <a href="gamemodes.html#comp-gamemode">Competitive Multiplayer</a> game mode. Each player has an experience bar at the bottom of the screen, and a level counter next to it. They can collect fight experience to level up and become even more dangerous to the others. The fight exp. collection methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>being in close range to other players (very low amount)</li>
                    <li>knocking other players (fair amount)</li>
                    <li>executing other players (very great amount)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Players can knock each other by jumping on the top of the others. This causes the loser player to lose a health, or when in one health, to get executed. Execution is a much more dangerous knock which gives the executed player Confusion and Invincibility effects, and the loser player <a href="#energy-mechanics">energy</a> and a lot of fight exp. After being executed, the player's health is set to the (level-dependant) basic.</p>
                <p>Leveling up is a huge progression for the players. Each level up restores the player to full health, but here are the other bonuses:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>a total of 2 health</li>
                    <li>a total of 3 health and higher jump after knocks</li>
                    <li>a total of 4 health and a lot of energy</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The first player to reach the maximum level becomes the Champion, and gets the Champion effect.</p>
            </section>
            <h2>Effects</h2>
            <p>Effects play a huge part in the game messing with the players. There are some helpful effects, but the most of them are trying to make them fall down to the unknown.</p>
